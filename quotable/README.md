## Usage
Quoatable is an application that allows users to save, favorite, update their favorite quotes. This was my first Ionic 2 application, it is a completed application, however it is a small scale application.


## Installation
To locally install this app run the following commands in the root of the project. Once application is installed it will be served on `localhost:8100`

```
npm install
ionic build
ionic serve
```
